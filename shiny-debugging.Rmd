# Overview

## Outline

We'll cover three main areas:

- Debugging
- Tracing 
- Errors

# Debugging

"Finding your bug is a process of confirming the many things that you believe are true â€” until you find one which is not true."

-- Norm Matloff

## Breakpoints

*Breakpoint (armed)*

*Stepping after execution*

## Breakpoints {.build}

### Pros

- Doesn't change code
- Can inspect local values/stack
- Can step through following code

### Cons

- Only works inside `shinyServer`
- Can't tell you why something isn't happening
- Interrupts program flow; not conditional

## browser()

![browser](images/browser.png)

## browser() {.build}

### Pros

- Similar advantages to breakpoints
- Valid anywhere an R expression is valid
- Can be made conditional

### Cons
 
- Changes your code!
- Interrupts program flow
- Can't tell you why something isn't happening

# Tracing

## Showcase Mode

![showcase mode](images/kmeans-showcase.gif)

```{r eval=FALSE}
runApp(..., display.mode="showcase")
```

## Reactive Log

![reactive log](images/reactlog.png)

```{r eval=FALSE}
options(shiny.reactlog=TRUE)
runApp(...)
showReactLog()
```

# Error Handling
